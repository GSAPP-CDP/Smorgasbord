title: Welcome to the GSAPP CDP Smorgasbord!
---
The Smorgasbord is a series of self-guided course modules, providing an introduction to the fundamentals of computation and spatial design for students entering the [GSAPP Computational Design Practices](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/programs/15-m-s-computational-design-practices) program. The tutorials are a complement to a series of CDP foundation classes, which will include discussions, reading, feedback and more tutorials. These tutorials are selected to provide a particular computational grounding to facilitate discussion, exploration, and creation of projects at the intersection of design, computation, and the built environment. 

While the Smorgasboard is designed as the pre-program curriculum for the GSAPP Masters of Science in Computational Design Practices, it also welcomes any student interested in Computational Design across all programs at GSAPP.
