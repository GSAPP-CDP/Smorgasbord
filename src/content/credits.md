The GSAPP-CDP Smorgasbord grew out of discussions between the CDP faculty listed below who have contributed tutorials to this site. The site will evolve and be updated over time to include more tutorials based on the evolving seminars taught by the [GSAPP Computational Design Practices](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/programs/15-m-s-computational-design-practices) program.

GSAPP-CDP pedagogy grew out of an evolving approach to flipped classroom teaching, which was encouraged in the Visual Studies and Visual Technology sequence of Masters of Architecture Program, directed by [Laura Kurgan](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/faculty/195-laura-kurgan) at GSAPP. This series of classes formed the basis of the Computational Design Practices Programs launched in July 2022. 

The following group of people have produced tutorials as well as were actively engaged in launching the new program
