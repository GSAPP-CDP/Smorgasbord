# Final Assignment: A Subjective Atlas

*[Jelte Boeijenga, Jeroen Mensink. Vinex Atlas. Cartography & book design by: Studio Joost Grootens. 2008](https://www.joostgrootens.nl/#atlases). See also [this video](https://vimeo.com/55867581) of the work.*

Design an atlas composed of your responses to each assignment from this module sequence.  

In the process of making your atlas revisit each assignment and revise your initial work. Some questions to consider when revising:

- what precedents is the project drawing on?
  - what are some similar or relevant precedent projects that I can draw from for inspiration/guidance? 
- what is the core argument or narrative? 
  - how might I make the subject/perspective/argument of this map more clear?  
  - how might I make the graphic approach more coherent? more related to the subject of the map?
  - what is the basemap? does it help to orient the reader? does it help to make the argument of the map more clear? if not, can it be re-designed to accomplish those goals?  
- what design approaches are used for the map elements? 
  - how is color being used? does it help to convey the narrative of the map?  
  - how are symbols being used? does each symbol convey a unique type of information?  
  - what role does each element of the map play in conveying the argument/narrative of the map? are there any unnecessary elements?  


Assemble your final maps into a single designed PDF booklet (with a designed cover page).  

Please include a thoughtful but (very) concise (1-2 sentence) description of each map.
