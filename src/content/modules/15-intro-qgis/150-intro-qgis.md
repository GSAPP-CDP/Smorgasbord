# Sequence: Introduction to Geographic Information Systems & Spatial Data

## Sequence Summary

This sequence of modules introduces key methods within geographic information systems (GIS) through hands-on work in the open source software platform QGIS.  

## Why?

Maps and geographic analysis are key tools for interpreting the built and social characteristics of cities. Thoughtful uses of spatial data can expose invisible patterns, and can change the way we see and engage with our world. However, maps are never just representations, they are always active in shaping the worlds they describe. With this in mind, the modules introduce approaches to gathering, visualizing, and interpreting spatial data as a starting point in the design process.

## Modules:

- Mapping where
- Print layouts and cartographic design
- Making Data from Archives
- Making Data From Observation & Sensing
- Making Data from Satellites
- Final Project: Urban Atlas
