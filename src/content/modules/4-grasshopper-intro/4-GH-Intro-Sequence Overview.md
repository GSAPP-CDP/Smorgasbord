# Sequence: Intro to Grasshopper

## Sequence Summary:

This sequence of modules is an introduction to computational design through Grasshopper and will cover everything you need to know to get started with grasshopper, key terminology and definitions through the development of a parametric tower.

By the end of this tutorial you will use computational design modeling to facilitate informed, data driven decision making through the generation and evaluation of hundreds or thousands of design options of your parametric tower.
