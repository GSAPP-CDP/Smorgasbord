# Sequence: Grasshopper as Tool-making Medium
## Sequence Summary:
This sequence of modules introduces Grasshopper as a tool-creating medium, merging concepts in HCI, spatial thinking, affordance theory to use Grasshopper as a medium for general computational design processes
## Why?
Thanks to the ecosystem of plugins, and Rhino/Grasshopperâ€™s integration with Python/C# and other programming languages, Rhino/Grasshopper is effectively an interface/prototyping platform for spatial design and computational experimentation. Thinking and understanding of Rhino/Grasshopper as a platform, rather than a modeling program, enables us to experiment with spatial computing in conjunction with other computational tools.
## Modules:
Smart Paintbrush: Geometry as Input, Basic logic, metrics:
Levels of Abstraction: Clusters and Plugins
Dashboards and Representation: Custom Preview, Human UI
Other Inputs: OSC, APIs, Data
Final Project: Urban Tradeoffs
