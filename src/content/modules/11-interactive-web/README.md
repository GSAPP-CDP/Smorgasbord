## HTML Basics
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and was invented in 1989 by Sir Timothy Berners-Lee, a computer scientist. The fundamental building block of HTML is the element. Elements consist of an opening tag, closing tag and content (text, image, video) sandwiched in between. The content is what the user sees on the webpage. The tags tell the browser the type of content and how to present it.

## CSS Basics
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and was invented in 1994 by HÃ¥kon Lie. It handles the presentation layer of our webpage and allows us to associate style rules with HTML elements.
