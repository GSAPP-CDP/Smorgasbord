## Module Summary
HTML is a markup language typically used to structure content on a web page with tags that convey to the browser the type of content and how it should be presented. In this lesson, we are going to use HTML in a visual manner that takes into consideration graphic space, design and meaning.

## What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and was invented in 1989 by Sir Timothy Berners-Lee, a computer scientist. Every website you’ve ever visited is rendered in HTML. Your web browser parses the HTML then renders the results.

HyperText is text that contains links to other texts. Markup describes a system of describing or annotating text files. Just like any language, HTML has its own vocabulary, grammar and syntax.

## Structural Markup

The fundamental building block of HTML is the element. Elements consist of an opening tag, closing tag and content (text, image, video) sandwiched in between. The content is what the user sees on the webpage. The tags tell the browser the type of content and how to present it.

## Tutorial 01

## Semantic Markup
Semantic elements tell web browsers something about the contents of the element. They designed to communicate the meaning of the content to the browser, developer, reader, and any other technologies interpreting the document (e.g. voice assistants, search engine web crawler, browser translation tools, or assistive technologies such as screen readers).

There are approximately 100 semantic elements available. There are approximately 100 semantic elements available. The following is a list of commonly used ones:

## Tutorial 02
For this exercise, let’s focus on presenting the text in different hierarchies and scales using the following HTML elements: . Do not link to external sites, rather link to parts of your poem using an attribute to assign an id . In doing so, think about how you can use the anchor links to meaningfully translate movement to your content.

Starter code for this tutorial can be found [here]().

## HTML Structure — Basic Requirements of a Web Page
HTML defines the structure and content of information on the page. All HTML pages have the same basic structure:

## Page Structure

### Nesting
Think of HTML tags as boxes that hold your content. That content can be text, images, or video. Sometimes, you need to place boxes inside of other boxes. Those “inner” boxes are nested inside of others. A perfect example of this is the bulleted list. The list items are nested inside of the unordered list tag.

### Relationships — HTML Hierarchy
We often use the same terms that we would use to describe the relationship between family members, to describe the relationship between HTML elements. Each element is related to another element in a parent-child-sibling relationship.

An element that is directly above another element in the hierarchy is called the parent of the element below it. The element below the parent is called the child. When two elements are equal in the hierarchy, they are known as siblings.

### Document Object Model (DOM) Tree
In the DOM Tree, the opening and closing  elements form the foundation upon which the rest of the document is built.

### Indentation
While indentation has no bearing on how the page is rendered in the browser, it is especially important for readability of your code. Indented code is easier to read, easier to understand, easier to modify, and easier to maintain (e.g. is you forget to include a closing tag). Common practice is to indent one tab space for any tags that are nested inside other tags.

Whatever format you decide to use, just be consistent.
