# Interactive Web: Introduction to JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to add interactivity to websites — dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images and 2D/3D graphics, and interact with the user. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web.

These three languages enable you to create complex and dynamic web pages.

## Why JavaScript?
JavaScript was built for front-end interaction, so it’s perfect for a designer. But now it’s also used on back-end interaction, so the syntax is familiar.

## Data Types
### Strings
Strings are collections of letters and symbols known as characters, and we use them to deal with words and text in JavaScript.

### Numbers
The number type represents both integers (whole numbers) and floating point numbers (decimals). To type a number into the console, just enter numerals without quotes. If you enter a number into the console, you’ll get that number back.

### Boolean
Boolean represents one of two values: `true` or `false`. Sometimes you’ll need to solve problems by adopting this same type of reduced true or false logic.

### Variables
Variables are used to store data types into the memory of the computer so that they can be referenced later — think of them like containers. It means you can name something and refer to it later as it will be stored in memory.

### Arrays
Arrays are a data structure similar in concept to a list. Each item in an array is called an element, and the collection can contain data of the same or different types. In JavaScript, they can dynamically grow and shrink in size.

#### Getting data from an array
To access, or retrieve, a value from an array, we will use the array name, followed by the index number, wrapped in square brackets.
```javascript
let colors = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green"];

colors[0];
// => "Red"

colors[3];
// => "Green"
```

#### Updating a value in an array
To update the value of an element in an array, specify the index number of the position where the updated value should be added.
```javascript
let colors = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green"];

colors[0] = "Blue"; // Update the value at index 0
```
Here we are replacing **"Red"** with **"Blue"**. The colors array now looks like this:
```javascript
["Blue", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green"]
```
