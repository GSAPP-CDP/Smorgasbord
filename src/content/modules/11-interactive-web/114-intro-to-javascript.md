## Module Summary

## Why is this important?

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to add interactivity to websites — dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images and 2D/3D graphics, and interact with the user. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web.

These three languages enable you to create complex and dynamic web pages.

### Why JavaScript?
JavaScript was built for front-end interaction, so it’s perfect for a designer. But now it’s also used on back-end interaction, so the syntax is familiar.

1. Access Content
2. Modify Content
3. Program Rules
4. React to Events
5. Smooth No Refresh User Experience
6. Communicate with a Server
