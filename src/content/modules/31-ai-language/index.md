## Artificial Intelligence – Language and Text

A major endeavor of AI and machine learning has been reasoning about **natural language**.

Under the larger topic of "natural language processing" (NLP), these methods are comprised 
both non-generative methods to analyze various aspects of natural language and generative
methods to create new text for other purposes. This is also adjacent to the field of 
"[computational linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics),"
the use of computation for modeling natural language.

Non-generative methods include tasks like:

- sentiment analysis – Extracting a quantitative sense of emotion from text.
- sentence similarity - Computing values that represent how similar two sentences are in meaning or structure.
- token classification - Assigning labels to words, like parts of speech or named entities.

Generative methods include tasks like:

- text generation - Generating text to complete a given prompt.
- summarization - Generating text that represents the original meaning of a longer text.
- translation - Generating semantically similar text using a different natural language from the source text.
