# Sequence: Ambient Computing: Interactivity
## Sequence Summary:
This sequence of modules introduces concepts of ambient computing including inclding interactivity inside of Processing. You will learn how to use Processing and create an interactive sketch. You will learn how to connect Processing to Microservices using Webhooks; how to work with sound and speech with a microphone and speakers; how to work with Processing Libraries; and how to track the movement of objects and people via a webcam.
## Why?
ambient computing 
low code prototypeability
interactivity

Ambient computing - the breakdown of separation between the computer and your environment - including XR
this moment of remote - telepresence and ability to communicate seamlessly between locations
ability to not leave your environment means ability to flip the notion of personalized devizes. Rather than one-person, one-computer, we can think about whole groups sharing experiences. We can design whole environments (rooms, public plazas) to have the intelligence of our computers, rather than individualized computers having such intelligence.
Whats at stake? Importance of breaking down the unintended consequences of individualized computing, 
Concepts designers must think through - permissioning (governance of groups), ethics of privacy and tracking, what is consent in group spaces?
