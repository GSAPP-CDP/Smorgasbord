# Sequence: Ambient Computing: Interactivity
## Sequence Summary:
Ambient computing broadly refers to computing done through ambient or contextual information on the many devices we use(smart home products, wearables, a work computer) to create seamless experiences relevant to the context of the environment.

embedded: many networked devices are integrated into the environment
context aware: these devices can recognize you and your situational context

This sequence of modules introduces concepts of ambient computing including interactivity in [Processing](https://processing.org/). You will learn how to use Processing to create interactive and user interfaces that are spatial. You will learn how to connect Processing to smart home products and web apps using Webhooks; how to work with sound and speech with a microphone and speakers; how to work with Processing Libraries; and how to track the movement of objects and people via a webcam.
## Why?
Ambient computing is an umbrella term for the hardware, software, user experience and human-computer interactions that can occur through ambient through  often distributed devices that don't require the direct interaction  
low code prototypeability
interactivity

Ambient computing - the breakdown of separation between the computer and your environment - including XR
this moment of remote - telepresence and ability to communicate seamlessly between locations
ability to not leave your environment means ability to flip the notion of personalized devizes. Rather than one-person, one-computer, we can think about whole groups sharing experiences. We can design whole environments (rooms, public plazas) to have the intelligence of our computers, rather than individualized computers having such intelligence.
Whats at stake? Importance of breaking down the unintended consequences of individualized computing, 
Concepts designers must think through - permissioning (governance of groups), ethics of privacy and tracking, what is consent in group spaces?
