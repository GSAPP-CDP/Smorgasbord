# Sequence: Ambient Computing: Interactivity
## Sequence Summary:
**Ambient computing** broadly refers to devices that are embedded in an environment and networked together and context aware i.e. pick up cues from the environment to create seamless experiences. Related to **internet-of-things** and **tangible computing**, ambient computing focuses on computing that blends with the environment to prioritize human centered experiences that don't separate the human from the environment.

This sequence of modules introduces concepts of ambient computing including interactivity in [Processing](https://processing.org/), a common programming environment for interactive art. You will learn how to use Processing to create interactive and user interfaces that are spatial. You will learn how to connect Processing to smart home products and web apps using Webhooks; how to work with sound and speech with a microphone and speakers; how to work with Processing Libraries; and how to track the movement of objects and people via a webcam.

## Why?
As computers get smaller and less expensive and cloud computing allows functionality between devices, ambient computing will be the most pertinant mode of computing in the near future. They are particularly important to spatial designers, the designs of homes and cities as they are concerned with how our digital interactions relate to physical space and social contexts.

Smart home products, wearables, Amazon Go Stores, and mixed reality all fall within ambient computing with the importance being on devices that are embedded in the environment and thus spatial as networked with other devices so that they can make contextual decisions (who you are, who your with, where you are, when it is, etc). Beyond these examples the rise of remote work has put increasing pressure on creating new modes for seamless communication between locations where people are not required to actively stare at screens and interact with their computers disembodied from the homes they live in.

Todays designers will have to grapple with the ethics of designing for these context aware systems - permissioning (governance of groups and what is consent in group spaces?), the ethics of privacy and tracking, and how invisible or predictive ambient systems should be.

Rather than one-person, one-computer, we can think about whole groups sharing experiences. We can design whole environments (rooms, public plazas) to have the intelligence of our computers, rather than individualized computers having such intelligence.

How to Do Nothing

ability to not leave your environment means ability to flip the notion of personalized devizes. 



Whats at stake? Importance of breaking down the unintended consequences of individualized computing, 
Concepts designers must think through - permissioning (governance of groups), ethics of privacy and tracking, what is consent in group spaces?
