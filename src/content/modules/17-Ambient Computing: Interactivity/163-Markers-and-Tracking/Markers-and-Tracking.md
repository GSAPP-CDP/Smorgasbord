# Sequence: Ambient Computing: Interactivity
## Sequence Summary:
This sequence of modules introduces concepts of ambient computing including inclding interactivity inside of Processing. You will learn how to use Processing and create an interactive sketch. You will learn how to connect Processing to Microservices using Webhooks; how to work with sound and speech with a microphone and speakers; how to work with Processing Libraries; and how to track the movement of objects and people via a webcam.
## Why?
ambient computing 
low code prototypeability
interactivity

Ambient computing - the breakdown of separation between the computer and your environment - including XR
this moment of remote - telepresence and ability to communicate seamlessly between locations
ability to not leave your environment means ability to flip the notion of personalized devizes. Rather than one-person, one-computer, we can think about whole groups sharing experiences. We can design whole environments (rooms, public plazas) to have the intelligence of our computers, rather than individualized computers having such intelligence.
Whats at stake? Importance of breaking down the unintended consequences of individualized computing, 
Concepts designers must think through - permissioning (governance of groups), ethics of privacy and tracking, what is consent in group spaces?

# Markers and Tracking
## Module Summary
In this module you will learn how to work with fiducial markers in Processing which will allow you to tie inputs (shapes in a UI, sound levels, turning smart home products on or off) to the position of a marker. 

## Conceptual Introduction, or: Why is this interesting / important?
Markers can be attached to any object: a chair, a desk, a wall, a floor, a person thus allowing for more spatial triggers.


## Tutorial

### Setup
**Hardware**
- **Laptop** — to run the code
- **Web Camera** — ideally separate from the laptop so that its easier to position the camera to find the markers
- **Projector** — to project realtime feedback into physical space
- **Fiducial Markers** — print out some of [these](http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/data/fiducials.pdf) Ideally they are quite large (one marker on an 8.5x11) so that a camera can pick up the marker across the room.
- Placement — Your webcam and projector should be pointing in the same direction, ideally from a similar location. Your markers should be out in a room but easily viewable by the webcam. Turn both the projector and the webcam on.
- **Webcam setup** — Sometimes Processing doesn’t recognize that another webcam is plugged in, and will default to your original webcam. To fix this we need to ensure
   - the camera is registered as on in another program before we launch Processing and TUIO.
      - Mac — search for “photo booth” from the finder, open it. In Photo Booth click Camera → select the camera you would like to use
      - PC — search for “camera” from the finder, choose you new camera. Further instructions here if needed. Close your Photo Booth or Camera app.
      
**Software**
- You will need [Processing 2.0](https://processing.org/download) or later.
- [Download TUIO here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/189WISuVLqTsM9A5eprC0qHGwemNUrEW8/view). **Unzip** and **move** it to Processing’s “libraries” folder.
- [Download ReacTIVision here].(http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/#files) 
   - You will need to download the appropriate version for your operating system (i.e. Windows 7 64bit or later, or MacOS X 10.8 or later).
   - You can check what operating system you have from a Mac by going to the `apple menu` → select `about` → in this menu you will see a version, for example **“Version 10.12.6”**. For windows type Computer in the search box, right-click on Computer, and then select `Properties`. Under Windows edition, you’ll see the version and edition of Windows that your device is running.
   - Once you’ve downloaded the right version of ReacTIVision, unzip the folder and move it into your applications folder.
- Launch ReacTIVision. 
   - You may get a warning that its an application from the internet. 
   - Hit Open or Accept. 
   - You should see green numbers layered ontop of the fiducial markers.

IMAGE

- Now open Processing and navigate to your libraries folder where you placed TUIO. Open TuioDemo.pde in Processing and hit play. (You must have reacTIVision still running. You should see black squares with the marker number that follow what is happening in the view. In the gif below I move the whiteboard moving the “5” marker, then sit in the chair obfuscating the “0” and “3” marker.
