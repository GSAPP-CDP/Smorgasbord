---

DRAFT NOTES/Outline:

--

Concept

- Grasshopper logic is an input/output/process logic / functional programming, flow-based programming. Context of other flow-based programming languages (Labview, MAX/MSP, NodeRED, Dynamo, Effects Chain)

- Encapsulation/Abstraction/Zoomable user interfaces; your script, too, can be abstracted!

- Pedal Effects Chain - Sound goes in, sound comes out. Sorting or reordering the pedal effects chain can itself create interesting results.

- The "Cluster" as both a Grasshopper tool, as well as a method to understand your own logic 
- (related; Telegraph plugin)

Exercise: 

- Updated version of cluster tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TTZkg34paE

- Exercise in creating combinatorics of clusters

- Line goes in, line goes out; number goes in, number goes out
