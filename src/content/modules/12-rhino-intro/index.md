# Sequence: Introduction to Rhino
## Sequence Summary:
This sequence introduces the basics of modeling in Rhino. We’ll go over the interface, how to use commands, and creating and modifying 2D and 3D geometry. We’ll develop these skills by creating a model of an existing architectural project.

## Why?

The ability to create, manipulate, and represent geometry in digital space is essential for many areas of computational design. Developing architectural, urban, or product designs, analyzing space a the scale of the object, city, or globe, or creating purely digital visualizations, animations, and interactive environments, all require the ability to work with 3D models and data.

Many different 3D modeling applications are available, with different advantages and limitations. In this sequence we'll be using [Rhino 3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/).

Rhino is an application for 2D drafting, 3D modeling, and visual representation that's become a standard tool for designers across a range of disciplines. It’s flexible, easy to learn, and supports a range of plugins (such as the rendering engine VRay) and programming languages (including Python). It includes Grasshopper, a versatile and powerful visual scripting interface. The kind of geometry it uses, called NURBS, works very well for architecture, furniture, product design, and other situations where you plan to translate your model into the physical world (in contrast to mesh-based applications like Blender, which are better suited to digital animation and game development).

Rhino is developed by a small company called McNeel, and is essentially their only product. If you’re a student (or teacher), it’s also pretty affordable, and licenses are purchased outright rather than through a subscription. If you run into trouble, the [McNeel Forums](https://discourse.mcneel.com/) have an active community of helpful Rhino users.
