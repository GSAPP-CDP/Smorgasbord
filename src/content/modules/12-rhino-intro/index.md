# Sequence: Introduction to Rhino
## Sequence Summary:
This sequence introduces the basics of the modeling application Rhino. We’ll go over the interface, how to use commands, and creating and editing 2D and 3D geometry. We’ll then apply what we’ve learned to create a simple model of an architectural project: Casa Bahia Azul, designed by Cecila Puga.

## Modeling
The ability to digitally create, manipulate, and represent three-dimensional geometry is an essiential skill for many areas of computational design. Developing architectural, urban, or product designs, analyzing space a the scale of the object, city, or globe, or creating purely digital visualizations, animations, and interactive environments, all require the ability to work with 3D models and data.

Many different 3D modeling applications are available, with different advantages and uses. In this sequence we'll be using one called [Rhino 3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/) .

## Why Rhino?
Rhino is an application for 2D drafting, 3D modeling, and visual representation that's become a standard tool for designers across a range of disciplines. It’s flexible, easy to learn, and supports a variety of plugins and scripting languages. The kind of geometry it uses, called NURBS, works very well for architecture, furniture, product design, and other situations where you plan to translate your model into the physical world. It’s developed by a small company called McNeel, and is essentially their only product. If you’re a student (or teacher), it’s also pretty affordable, and licenses are purchased outright rather than through a subscription.

If you run into trouble, the [McNeel Forums](https://discourse.mcneel.com/) have an active community of helpful Rhino users.
