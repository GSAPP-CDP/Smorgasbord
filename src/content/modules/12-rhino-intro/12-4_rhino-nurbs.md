# Modeling with NURBS
## Module Summary:
We were able model the Casa Bahia Azul using simple extrusions made of polylines with straight segments. This module introduces the use of freeform curves and surfaces in Rhino. It will first give a brief overview of what NURBS geometry is and how it works. It will then use NURBS modeling to create the terrain surrounding the building.

- Splines
- Control Points
- Degree
- Control Point Weights
- NURBS surfaces
- Lofting
- NetworkSrf
- Patch
- Blend
- Rebuild

## Post-Sequence Challenge
Introduce a challenge to take another building (list of potential options provided, selected from ADR precedent list) and create a model of it.
