# Sequence: Introduction to Rhino
## Sequence Summary:
This sequence introduces the basics of the modeling application Rhino. We’ll go over the interface, how to use commands, and creating and editing 2D and 3D geometry. We’ll then apply what we’ve learned to create a simple model of an architectural project: Casa Bahia Azul, designed by Cecila Puga.
## Why Rhino?
Rhino is an application for 2D drafting, 3D modeling, and visual representation that has become a standard tool for designers across a range of disciplines. It’s flexible, easy to learn, and supports a range of plugins and scripting languages. The kind of geometry it uses, called NURBS, works very well for for architecture, furniture, product design, and other applications where you plan to translate your model into the physical world. It’s developed by a small company called McNeel, and is essentially their only product. If you’re a student (or teacher), it’s also pretty affordable, and licenses are purchased outright rather than through a subscription.
