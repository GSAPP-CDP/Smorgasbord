# Sequence: Introduction to Geographic Information Systems & Spatial Data

## Sequence Summary:

This sequence of modules introduces foundational concepts in geographic information systems (GIS) and the use of spatial data for urban research and as part of design processes. Modules provide a conceptual overview of fundamentals of spatial data, coordinate reference systems, and elementary geoprocessing techniques that is software agnostic.  

## Why?

The increasingly widespread availability of up-to-date (or even real-time) spatial data is changing the landscape of possibility for design workflows and methods of urban analysis. Having a robust understanding of concepts central to spatial analysis makes it possible to develop fluency in methods of spatial computation across a range of platforms and software environments. Geographic information systems is not a software, but rather a set of related methods which can be implemented in a range of softwares and programming languages.  

## Modules:

- What is GIS?
- Spatial Data - Information Tied to a Space
- Coordinate Reference Systems & Projections
- Finding Spatial Data

## What's next

After completing the Introduction to Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Data module sequence you may choose to continue learning spatial concepts in multiple processing/software environments.
