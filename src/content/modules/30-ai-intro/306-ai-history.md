## "The Imitation Game" aka "The Turing Test"

The "Imitation Game" is a straw-person argument authored by computing pioneer Alan Turing, 
who posited that exploring AI by defining "intelligence" would be semantically difficult 
(if not impossible), and he instead presented a counterpoint thought experiment published 
in the Journal _Mind_ in 1950, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (Mind, issue 59, 
pgs 433-460, 1950). He made the case that the mimicry of a human, when communicating only 
with text responses, is sufficient to practically define an "intelligent" machine.

The Imitation Game sets up an interview scenario in which an interviewer has tightly constrained 
access to two interviewees, through exchanging only slips of paper with them while sitting in 
isolated rooms. He suggests an truly "intelligent" computing system could fool the human
interviewer (who would merely have these short text exchanges) into believing it itself
is human. Turing explores a number of subtleties, arguments, and cases around this scenario 
made in his essay.

(Note that this essay has statements you may see as controversial or offensive. Rather than 
defend this as "just the way things were," I'd recommend reading the paper as a historical 
artifact rather than an endorsement of such a position.)

The "Turing Test" is arguably not as productive a thought experiment today as it was when 
originally posed, but it does raise questions still relevant. It's somewhat curious that the 
AI tools since 2022 getting the most attention are delivered as chat interfaces.


## Turing Machines

Alan Turing made significant and foundational contributions to our understanding of computing 
systems and of computation, perhaps the most notable of which is the so-called "Turing Machine,"
which is a reductive model of what constitutes a fully capable computing machine.

If one can prove equivalency of a given system to the simple axioms of a Turing Machine, one 
has proven such a system can compute _anything_ that any other complete computing system can. 
We say such a system is "Turing complete." And some counterintuitive languages, like the latest 
versions of CSS (cascading style sheets) are indeed Turing complete.
