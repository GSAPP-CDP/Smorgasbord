## AI Governance

The "governance" of AI refers to the decision-making processes and powers to guide the 
development of AI.

From a governmental perspective, this most often refers to regulations and laws that govern the
responsibilities and liabilities of companies developing AI, agencies that may employ AI methods,
and individuals who consume or use AI, or whose information may be used by AI in training.

### The EU AI Act

The most prominent governance actions by a government is the EU AI Act, which as of this 
writing (mid-2024) is in the latest stages of approval by the European Union.
