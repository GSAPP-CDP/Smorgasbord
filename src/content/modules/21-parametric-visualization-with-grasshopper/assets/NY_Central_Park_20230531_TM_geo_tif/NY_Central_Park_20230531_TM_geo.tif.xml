      <abstract>US Topo map converted from GeoPDF/Geospatial PDF to GeoTIFF. Geospatial data included in each map varies, but may include orthoimagery, roads, grids, geographic names, elevation contours, hydrography, and other selected map features. US Topo GeoPDF maps were designed specifically for the capability to turn individual layers on and off. GeoTIFFs do not provide for that capability and thus, certain layers will not be available on the GeoTIFFs that are available in the PDFs. The selection of layers to show on the GeoTIFFs was based solely on cartographic design, and so it is recommended that the PDF be downloaded if there is interest in the full set of layers. For each PDF published since October 2013, two GeoTIFFs are available. PDF maps published prior to that date are not available in GeoTIFF. Both GeoTIFFs exclude shaded relief, woodland, and several Federal Administrative Land boundary layers (National Cemetery, Department of Defense, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife and Native Lands) specifically for reasons of clarity based upon the cartographic design. One of the GeoTIFFs has the orthoimage layer turned off, and the other has the orthoimage turned on. In the latter case, contours and wetlands layers also are turned off, again for cartographic clarity. Data layers not included in the GeoTIFFs can be added to the map depiction in a GIS by downloading the associated file from The National Map (TNM), or by linking to a map service. For example, the woodland polygon data layer is available for download. This data was derived and generalized from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) which is also available as a map service from TNM provide a woodland representation.</abstract>
      <purpose>This map depicts geographic features on the surface of the earth. It is a general purpose map for users who are not GIS experts. One
        intended purpose is to support emergency response at all levels of government.</purpose>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>US Topo map products in GeoPDF are compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). NMAS horizontal accuracy requires that at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within 0.02 inch of the true position. In this product, the projection line, grids, and orthoimage are believed to meet NMAS. Positional accuracy of the other data layers is less controllable because of diversity of data sources, and may not meet NMAS. The digital GeoTIFF version of the map was created with a methodology that preserves, but does not exceed, the accuracy of the original GeoPDF/Geospatial PDF map.</horizpar>

      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>Vertical accuracy report: US Topo contours are derived from the USGS 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) 1/3 arc-second DEM data. Accuracy
          of 3DEP is inherited from various sources. These data sources vary in vertical accuracy depending on time of collection, collection method,
          control accuracy and density, and local terrain relief. The overall absolute vertical accuracy of the 1/3 arcsecond DEM data, as tested
          against GPS control, is about 3 meters at 95% confidence level (National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy). US Topo contours are derived
          from the DEMs to generally meet National Map Accuracy Standards (90% of well-defined points in reasonably level terrain test within one-half
          contour interval of the true ground elevation); however, actual vertical accuracies of individual US Topo quadrangles may not meet that
          standard. Quadrangles containing collar notes stating contours "May not meet National Map Accuracy Standards" are in areas where the source
          is known to be questionable for meeting NMAS for the stated contour interval.</vertaccr>

            <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>This contour featureclass was generated from the 1/3 arc-second version of the 3D Elevation Program. The intended
							viewing scale for these features is 1:24,000. The contours are derived from a filtered elevation raster to achieve
							smoother arcs. In some areas, the 3DEP data may be modified by the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) flow lines and water
							bodies to facilitate improved integration between the hypsography and hydrography on USGS map products. These contours
							were generated primarily for use as a layer in GeoPDFs created in the digital mapping program. The raster data source of
							contours is the 3D Elevation Program 1/3 arc-second layer. Secondary datasets include the high resolution flow lines,
							water bodies, and areas from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The NHD layers are used in hydro-enforcement of the
							DEM prior to contour generation. The goals of the hydro-enforcement are to prevent contour lines from extending over the
							surface of water bodies and to align the contour reentrants with the NHD single- line streams. The 3DEP raster cells are
							converted to points. Those points, along with the NHD flow lines are input into an interpolation tool to create a new
							surface. The NHD water bodies and areas are preprocessed to attach the minimum and maximum elevation to each polygon. From
							these precalculated values, an appropriate value is calculated by which to raise the elevation cells under the NHD
							polygons. The NHD polygons are then converted into rasters, which in turn will be used to generate a mosaic that includes
							the new raster surface. The mosaic is filtered to provide smoother contour lines. Contours are generated and depression
							and index contours are identified. There is no guarantee or warranty concerning the accuracy of the data. Users should be
							aware that temporal changes may have occurred since these data were collected and generated and that some parts of these
							data may no longer represent actual surface conditions. Hydro-enforcement and generalization can also significantly alter
							the spatial characteristics of the contours. Users should not use these data for critical applications without a full
							awareness of its limitations.</othercit>

            <othercit>The Woodland Tint is a derivative land cover product created using the most recent National Land Cover Database (NLCD) raster data, 
			  as well as vector data from the National Hydrography Dataset and National Transportation Dataset. For CONUS, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico/U.S. Virgin Islands, 
			  NLCD Tree Canopy Cover is masked with NLCD Percent Developed Imperviousness (values from 1-100). The resulting dataset with Tree Canopy Cover of 20-100% is 
			  used as the input raster to generate woodland polygons. For Alaska, 3 values (41 -Deciduous Forest, 42 - Evergreen Forest, and 43 - Mixed Forest) are extracted 
			  from NLCD Land Cover to create the input raster used to generate woodland polygons. The woodland polygons are masked with buffered Transportation (Roads, Airport 
			  Runways, and Railroads) and Hydrography (NHD Areas excluding Inundation Area and NHD Waterbodies excluding Swamp/Marsh). The resulting polygons are checked for 
			  scale appropriate size (minimum size of one acre), and the small woodland polygons as well as small clearings within the woodland polygons are deleted. Resulting 
			  woodland vector polygons are smoothed via the PAEK Algorithm.</othercit>

            <othercit>Airport points and runway polygons are for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-recognized public and private airports in the United States. USGS updates the National Transportation Dataset (NTD) airports, runways approximately bi-monthly from FAA’s modification reports.  In April 2020, USGS started creating the seaplane base and heliport layers. FAA is the primary source for seaplane bases and heliports. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency provided heliport updates for IN, KY, MI, MS, OH, and TN. Digital data were inspected for attribute accuracy, spatial accuracy, and completeness.</othercit>

            <othercit>Recreational trails were first added to US Topo maps in 2013. The trails displayed on the US Topo are from multiple government agencies. Accuracy and currency vary by source and are the responsibility of the data owner. USGS evaluates the authoritativeness of the source but does not independently verify data accuracy. USGS does not modify the trails data except to remove duplicate trails and in some cases trails coincident with roads. Users should always consult local agencies for the most current trail information.                         
              
              This is not a complete dataset and is subject to change at any time. Content will be added as data become available from land management agencies and other authoritative sources. This metadata section documents data sources for all maps, not this specific map. Trails listed here may not be present on all relevant maps due to schedule differences between data delivery and US Topo production schedules. US Topo does not portray access and travel management information about specific trails. Feature-level metadata is not provided in the US Topo product and there is no link between a line on the map and the source of that specific trail.  
              
              Trails on federal lands were provided by U.S. Forest Service (USFS), National Park Service (NPS), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The sources of National Scenic Trails (NST) include: Continental Divide NST provided by the Continental Divide Trail Coalition in cooperation with the USFS; New England NST provided by NPS and the Appalachian Mountain Club; Ice Age NST provided by the volunteer organization Ice Age Trail Alliance in cooperation with NPS and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources; Pacific Crest NST provided by USFS; Appalachian NST published by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy in cooperation with NPS and USFS; North Country NST provided by NPS; Arizona NST data published by AZGEO Clearinghouse in cooperation with USFS; Pacific Northwest NST provided by USFS; Natchez Trace NST provided by NPS; Florida NST provided by the USFS; Potomac Heritage NST provided by NPS. National Scenic Trails will have breaks in the network. This is due to lack of coverage provided by the trail source or a removal of trails coincident with roads. In some cases, USGS will replace a segment of NST on federal or state lands if the land management agency provides a more accurate trail centerline than the original NST source. The replaced segment will be designated as a National Scenic Trail. 
              
              Trails from state partners are included and provided by the State departments of Natural Resources, Parks and Recreation, Parks and Wildlife, or similar departments. This data includes AK, AR, CA, CO, CT, IA, ID, IN, KY, MI, MO, ND, NE, NJ, OH, TN, TX, UT, WA, WV.  Additional state partner data will be integrated into the Trails dataset over time and may not be listed here. 
              
              Some US Topo products may display trails provided by the International Mountain Bicycling Association (IMBA); however, IMBA trails are being phased out of USGS products and will not be shown on future versions of the map.</othercit>

            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>Dataset source is Census Bureau MAF/TIGER database extracts in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles. The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S.  Census Bureau's Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent dataset, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The U.S. Geological Survey filters Census roads to remove driveways and short local unnamed road segments which are less than 500 feet in length. The USGS National Transportation Dataset functional road classification system is applied to the Census datasets. The functional road class includes, limited access highway, secondary highway, local connector, local road 4wd, tunnel, ferry route, and closed. Closed roads were approved in 2020 to align with USFS schema and will be incorporated into the NTD in 2021. The original TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau. The horizontal spatial accuracy information present in the TIGER/Line shapefiles is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only and the data may not be suitable for high-precision measurement applications. Full metadata for TIGER/Line shapefiles is available from U.S. Census Bureau.</othercit>

            <othercit>This dataset depicts National Park Service unit boundaries for display and general analysis purposes. The USGS converted areas
              of generally 3 acres or less to point features to facilitate cartographic display on the US Topo digital map product. See Source URL for
              link to complete dataset. This data set is complete but subject to continual updates to reflect boundary amendments, legislation, and
              acquisitions, and improved processing techniques. The data is being regularly updated with verified boundaries from NPS Land Resources
              Division. The data is intended for use as a tool for display and general GIS analysis purposes only. It is in no way intended for
              engineering or legal purposes. The data accuracy is checked against best available sources which may be dated. NPS assumes no liability
              for use of this data. Boundaries from the Land Resources Division have separate polygons for each type of unit. For example Denali
              National Park and Denali National Preserve are separate individual polygons.</othercit>

            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the United States and
              its Territories. While the Fish and Wildlife Service produces a variety of wetland categories, only two (Emergent and Forest/Shrub
              wetlands as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979)) are included on US Topo Maps.The emergent wetlands depicted do not include lakes, rivers,
              open water ponds, deepwater marine and estuarine features or non-vegetated, farmed, intermittent and temporarily flooded wetlands. The
              goal is to provide a visual depiction of the approximate location and extent of Emergent and Forest/Shrub wetlands. Digital wetlands
              data are intended for use with base maps and digital aerial photography at a scale of 1:12,000 or smaller. Due to the scale, the primary
              intended use is for data display on the US Topo Maps. This data display is not intended for analysis. The map products were neither
              designed or intended to represent legal or regulatory products. Questions or comments regarding the interpretation or classification of
              wetlands can be addressed by visiting https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/FAQs.html These data were developed in conjunction with the
              publication Cowardin, L.M., V. Carter, F.C. Golet, and E.T. LaRoe. 1979. Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United
              States. U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC. FWS/OBS-79/31. For more information on the wetland
              classification codes visit https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Wetland-Codes.html. Note that coastline delineations were drawn to follow
              the extent of wetland features as described by this project and may not match the coastline shown in other base maps.</othercit>

            <geoform>raster digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>The Shaded relief is a derivative elevation product created from the USGS 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) 1/3 arc-second DEM data.
              First there are five separate shaded relief datasets created from the original data. Each shaded relief has different azimuths and
              altitude values as follows: 00 450, 1350 600, 2700 450, 3150 450, 450 450. These five datasets are then combined into one feature class
              using map algebra to compute the raster layers using the following equation shadedrelief1 + shadedrelief2 + shadedrelief3 +
              (shadedrelief4 x 2) + shaded relief5 \ 6. This equation gives double importance to the 3150 azimuth and 450 elevation.</othercit>

        <procdesc>All geospatial content is taken from national geospatial databases under the stewardship of USGS data programs. The NAIP and SPOT imagery is provided by a seamless tile service that delivers image data at a predetermined resolution and quality. The raster and vector data, including grids and collar information, are processed using ESRI ArcGIS software and exported as a geospatial PDF using ESRI ArcGIS software. Map formatting is performed using a custom application, which includes post-processing to embed the metadata XML document and legend. The final GeoTIFF produced from the PDF is downsampled to 300 PPI, compressed, and zipped with an external metadata file. In addition, the projection of the GeoTIFFs are modified to accommodate a rotation of the maps so that the data frame is square to the page(the central meridian is shifted, modifying the projection from Universal Transverse Mercator to Transverse Mercator). All properties of the original PDF projection are retained.
