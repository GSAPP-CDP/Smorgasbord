  Description:
    Abstract: This tile of the National Elevation Dataset (NED) is 1/9 arc-second resolution. The National Elevation Dataset (NED) serves the elevation layer of The National Map, and provides basic elevation information for earth science studies and mapping applications in the United States. Scientists and resource managers use NED data for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping and visualization, and many other applications. The NED is an elevation dataset that consists of seamless layers and a high resolution layer. Each of these layers are composed of the best available raster elevation data of the conterminous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, territorial islands, Mexico and Canada. The NED is updated continually as new data become available. All NED data are in the public domain. The NED are derived from diverse source data that are processed to a common coordinate system and unit of vertical measure. These data are distributed in geographic coordinates in units of decimal degrees, and in conformance with the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). All elevation values are in meters and, over the continental United States, are referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). The vertical reference will vary in other areas. NED data are available nationally (except for Alaska) at resolutions of 1 arc-second (approx. 30 meters) and 1/3 arc-second (approx. 10 meters), and in limited areas at 1/9 arc-second (approx. 3 meters). In most of Alaska, only lower resolution source data are available. As a result, most NED data for Alaska are at 2-arc-second (approx. 60 meters) grid spacing. Part of Alaska is available at the 1- and 1/3-arc-second resolution from IFSAR collections starting in 2010. Plans are in place for collection of statewide IFSAR in Alaska through 2016.
    Purpose: The NED serves as the elevation layer of The National Map, and provides basic elevation information for earth science studies and mapping applications in the United States.  The data are utilized by the scientific and resource management communities for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping and visualization applications.
    Supplemental_Information: This tile of the National Elevation Dataset (NED) is 1/9 arc-second resolution, Image file format, and covers a one degree block. The geographic area of coverage is described below in the Bounding Coordinates. Additional information for the NED may be found on http://ned.usgs.gov/. Data may be downloaded through The National Map Viewer: http://nationalmap.gov/viewer.html. Direct links for direct access by automated services are provided in the Distribution section of this metadata.

        USGS NED ned19_n41x00_w074x00_ny_hudsonbay_2011 1/9 arc-second 2012 15 x 15 minute IMG. Original data provided by the Rolla, Missouri National Geospatial Technical Operations Center (NGTOC).  At the Rolla NGTOC, the data were reviewed in Global Mapper for errors and then converted to 1/9 arc-second ERDAS Imagine images for shipment to the USGS EROS for further processing.
        ARRA Lidar data for Hudson Bay area, New York were processed into a NED 1/9th dataset at EROS using the ESRI Geographic Information System (GIS). The data were delivered to EROS as two ERDAS formatted image files projected to a UTM, Zone 18N coordinate system.  The data were mosaicked and project to geographic coordinate system decimal degrees-NAD83.  Data inspection was completed by comparing the final derived DEM and shaded-relief products to the NED 1/3rd DEM and shaded-relief products, along with high-resolution optical imagery.  Visual analysis of the data revealed few anomalies in the data.  After visual analysis was complete the data was loaded into ArcSDE to be made available for public access and downloading.
        Metadata was created for display through The National Map Viewer at http://nationalmap.gov/viewer.html in XML format.
