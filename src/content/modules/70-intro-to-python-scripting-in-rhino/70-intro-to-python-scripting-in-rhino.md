# Sequence: Intro to Python Scripting in Rhino

## Sequence Summary:

This sequence introduces the programming language Python, and the various ways in which you can use it both on it's own and to control other design software like Rhino.

## Why?

Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, mostly for it's relatively straight forward syntax and shallow learning curve. Due to this popularity, it has become the language of choice for many displines outside of computer programming, including natural sciences, data science, and even fine art. In recent years many design tools have also begun to support Python as their native scripting language, meaning you can use Python to control and customize the software to your needs.

## Modules:

- Using Python in Grasshopper
- Accessing the Rhino API in Python
- Working with geometry in Python
