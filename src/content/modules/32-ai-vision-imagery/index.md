## Computer Vision

Computer vision (or CV) refers to non-generative AI techniques that enable computers
to identify patterns in and extract data from pixellated images sourced from cameras.

From a human perspective, these techniques are intended to mimic humans' and animals'
vision abilities, from identifying objects to even in some cases, to extract an
understanding of spatial depth and positioning.


## Image Analysis

This set of methods refers to abilities to extract data and information from raster data.
For example:

- depth estimation - Computing z-depth distance values from a given image.
- image classification - Producing a label that represents the content of an image
- object detection - Producing outlines and labels of perceived physical objects from an image.


## Image Generation

This category refers to a set of tasks, techniques, and models that generate imagery given 
a set of inputs, like text prompts or other images.

- text-to-image - Generating an image derived from the meaning of a given text.
- text-to-video - Generating an animated image derived from the meaning of a given text.
- image-to-image - Producing new images based on previous images, such as style transfer.
