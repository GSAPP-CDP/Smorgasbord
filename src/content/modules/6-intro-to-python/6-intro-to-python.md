# Sequence: Intro to Python

## Sequence Summary:

This sequence is an introduction to the Python programming language, covering how to get setup with the tools used for writing, editing, and executing Python code on your machine.

This sequence introduces the programming language Python, and the various ways in which you can use it both on it's own and to control other design software like Rhino.

## Why?

One of the most common questions asked by individuals new to writing Python code is: “What can I do with Python?”. The breadth of things you can do in Python is why it consistently appears as one of the [top 5 programming languages](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-popular-technologies) to learn. From creating a machine learning model that predicts building energy consumption, creating a trading platform, to developing desktop games, Python is a highly versatile, general purpose programming language with a very large online community of users. As such, there are a myriad of ways to interact with Python, some better suited for certain types of tasks or disciplines. This sequence will introduce the three most common tools to write Python: Jupyter Notebooks, IDEs and the command line.

Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, mostly for it's relatively straight forward syntax and shallow learning curve. Due to this popularity, it has become the language of choice for many displines outside of computer programming, including natural sciences, data science, and even fine art. In recent years many design tools have also begun to support Python as their native scripting language, meaning you can use Python to control and customize the software to your needs.
