Summary:

Incorporating other inputs such as OSC, APIs, to trigger or activate operations in Grasshopper, allowing Grasshopper interoperability with other plugins

DRAFT NOTES/outline

CONCEPT:

- Grasshopper is a prototyping platform; a way to incorporate many different technologies into a spatial medium
- References: Dynamicland as a spatial computer; Grasshopper as a spatial model of computing

TUTORIAL:

- Reading from a file, and parsing/formatting via text split
- Reading from an OSC stream (FaceOSC), parsing/formatting, then 'driving' a simpel 3d model
- Reading from an API, parsing via JSON

Challenge: connect one software on your computer (OSC, Midi input, etc) to Grasshopper using either a file or OSC. Create a simple 3d-visualization
