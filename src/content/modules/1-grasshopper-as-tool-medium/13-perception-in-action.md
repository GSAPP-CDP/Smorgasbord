DRAFT NOTES/outline

CONCEPT:

- Affordances and color as a crucial aspect of human-computer interfaces. What is alterable & perceived to be alterable?
- References: The infographics of color spectrum / heatmaps, scientifically chosen color spectra
- Reading: Alva Noe, Perception in Action -- to engage in a feedback loop based on action, then perceiving the action, is what makes change possible.

TUTORIAL:

- Using Custom Preview & custom preview viewport filters
- Human UI to create an interface
- Flounder camera control to synchronize & control cameras

- Exercise 1: create an interesting synced set of views that allows you to understand multiple aspects of a 3d model at the same time
- Challenge: create a weird, novel, experimental perception-action loop by changing how the camera and the UI is used
