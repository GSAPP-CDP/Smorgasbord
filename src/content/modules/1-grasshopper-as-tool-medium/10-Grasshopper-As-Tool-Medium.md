# Grasshopper as Tool-making Medium

## Sequence Summary

Rhino/Grasshopper is often used as a 3D-modeling and parametric computation environment. However, thanks to the ecosystem of plugins, programming language integration, Grasshopper has flourished into a general-purpose spatial computational environment, alongside tools like Unity, Blender/Sverchok, or Dynamo. and understand Grasshopper as a medium for experimentation, tool-building, that can augment design practices. 

This sequence is a short introduction to exploring Grasshopper as as a spatial medium: a medium that enables the creation of tools, designs, and experiments in computational design thinking.
