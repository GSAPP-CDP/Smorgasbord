title: "Final Project: Spatial Tradeoffs"
published: True

Summary:

A combination of all previous modules, asking learners to create a tool that explores different tradeoffs / constraints within a design space

DRAFT NOTES/outline

CONCEPT:

- Thinking of computation is a tool helps us use constraints, not to decide for us
- References: recent reading on human-augmented design, Github CoPilot, etc

CHALLENGE:

Create a tool that uses the previous techniques that INFORMS and SUPPORTS the designer to change how they design
