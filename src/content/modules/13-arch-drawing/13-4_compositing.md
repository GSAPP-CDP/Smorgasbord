# Assembling a Composite Drawing
## Module Summary

All modules up to this point have shown how to create drawings directly from Rhino. This one will show techniques for creating elements of a drawing in Rhino, and then compositing them together using Photoshop and Illustrator, through the creation of a Section Perspective.

- Creating vector section linework, exporting to illustrator
- Creating Rhino view settings for compositing (layer ID, diffuse, ambient occlusion, linework, etc)
- Compositing view captures
- combining Photoshop & illustrator files

## Post-Sequence Challenge
Take the building modeled for the Sequence 12 challenge and create two drawings of it: a section perspective and an exploded axonometric. What is important to show? What elements of the building are you trying to emphasize? Can you use these two drawings to make an argument about the building?
