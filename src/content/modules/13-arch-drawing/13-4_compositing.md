# Assembling a Composite Drawing
## Module Summary

All modules up to this point have shown how to create drawings directly from Rhino. This one will show techniques for creating elements of a drawing in Rhino, and then compositing them together using Photoshop and Illustrator, through the creation of a Section Perspective.

## Tutorial

Overview TK: Collage and Composite

### Custom View Settings

So far we've been using Rhino's built-in display modes, which work fine for modeling. But to create images of our model, we'll want to take control of what it looks like. Fortunately Rhino's view settings have tons of options for customization.

- make one that looks good, for screen capturing: arctic + linework?

### View Settings for Compositing

Having some unique view settings that you like is great for producing sketches very quickly. But we can also create view settings that capture different elements from or information about the scene, and use those as raw material for producing intentional, well-developed drawings in Photoshop that we could never get directly from the viewport.

- linework
- lighting
- shadows
- ambient occlusion 
- layer ID
- diffuse
- Z depth

## Post-Sequence Challenge
Take the building modeled for the Sequence 12 challenge and create two drawings of it: a section perspective and an exploded axonometric. What is important to show? What elements of the building are you trying to emphasize? Can you use these two drawings to make an argument about the building?
