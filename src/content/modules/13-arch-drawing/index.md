# Sequence: Introduction to Architectural Drawing
## Sequence Summary:

This sequence covers workflows for creating drawings from a Rhino model. It first covers the production of orthographic plans and sections, then drawings using perspective and parallel projection, followed by basic rendering, and finally compositing images in Photoshop and Illustrator. Along the way it provides conceptual and historical context for these different types of drawing.

## Why?

Designers, computational or otherwise, are generally not in the business of personally executing the things they design. They communicate their designs to others through drawings and other media. A design proposal—or, for that matter any analysis, explanation, or argument—is only as powerful as the documentation which conveys it to its intended audience. The best way to communicate a spatial idea depends on its content, and new ideas call for new methods of representation. But there are drawing standards and conventions which are readily understood by other designers and those they collaborate with, and these provide a common baseline language for visual communication. Designers who are comfortable speaking this language can most effectively adapt, subvert, or innovate upon it to convey their ideas.

This sequence is an introduction to the production of drawings using this common language. It approaches the topic from the vantage point of architectural design, but the essential problem of depicting three-dimensional space and data on a two-dimensional page or screen is relevant across design disciplines, and many of the conventions and skills described here are broadly applicable.

The subject of the drawings in these tutorials will be the Casa Bahia Azul, designed by Cecilia Puga, which was modeled in the Introduction to Rhino tutorial sequence.
