# Procedural Density and Building Types

![description](images/5-5-0_Teaser.gif)


## Module Summary

This module we will complete the inputs and procedural modeling portion of your Computational Design Model by using the density location geometry to procedurally generate building types at different densities (ie heights) and introduce an input to control the degree of density variation. We will also include an average overall density as a static input.

## Why is this important?
