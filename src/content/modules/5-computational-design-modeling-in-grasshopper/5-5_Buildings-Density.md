# Procedural Density and Building Types

![description](images/5-5-0_Teaser.gif)


## Module Summary

In this module we will complete the inputs and procedural modeling portion of your Computational Design Model by using the density location geometry to procedurally generate building types at different densities (ie heights) and introduce an input to control the degree of density variation. We will also include an average overall density as a static input.

## Why is this important?

This modules expands on the concepts and techniques cover in the previous section with a focus on developing the procedural generation. Again we will need to be critical about what inputs we design manually in Rhino vs parametrically in Grasshopper. Finally, this module is important because it further reinforces your agency as a designer in the design of building types to be mapped within your parametric street grid.

## Tutorial

This tutorial has five sections:

1. Procedurally generating building density based on the density location geometry.
2. Turn parcels into "Boxes."
3. Sorting between low, medium and high density parcel "Boxes."
4. Design and Prep Building Types.
5. Morphing manually designed building types into low, medium, high density "Boxes."

This module uses `Box Morph` to Morph or Map source geometry (buildings we design in Rhino) into the parcels we developed in the previous module. The basic workflow is very straight forward (as pictured above.) Box morph is looking for `Geometry to Morph (G)`, a `Source Box (R)` which is generated using `Bounding Box` (right click in the center and change to `Union Box`,) and a `Target Box (T)` to morph the source geometry into, most often generated by using `Blend Box` to create a box between two surfaces. In the example above we subdivided two lofted surfaces to make blended boxes as our target.
